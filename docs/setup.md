In order to scan a valid public IP must be submitted on the /scan page, the api seems to have a limit on how many scans we can do so sometimes a valid IP scan can fail as the API refuses to serve the Info.

In order to see the data from scans, you must go to the host data page, this will have a dropdown menu of scans you can access and will give you info on that scan when clicked. You can only access scans that your user account created.
